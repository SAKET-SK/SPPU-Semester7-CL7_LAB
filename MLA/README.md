PROBLEM STATEMENT:Principal Component Analysis-Finding Principal
Components, Variance and Standard Deviation calculations of principal
components.

OBJECTIVE:
 To understand Principle Component, Variance and Standard Deviation.
 To Compute Principle component
 Assess how many principal components should be considered in an analysis;
 Determine when a principal component analysis may be based on the variance-
covariance matrix, and when the correlation matrix should be used;
